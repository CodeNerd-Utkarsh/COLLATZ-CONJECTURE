# COLLATZ-CONJECTURE

* The simplest Math Problem No-One Can/Want Solve. one that young mathematicians are warned, not to waste time on.

* It's a simple conjecture problem that not even the world's best mathematicians have been able to solve.

* The conjecture is named after **<u>Lothar Collatz</u>** , who introduced the idea in **<u>1937</u>**, two years after receiving his doctorate.

```
"Mathematics is not yet ripe enough for such question."

- Paul Erdos

* It is also known as the **3n + 1 problem**,
* the **3n + 1 conjecture**,
* the **Ulam conjecture** (after Stanis≈Çaw Ulam),
* **Kakutani's problem** (after Shizuo Kakutani),
* **Thwaites conjecture (after Sir Bryan Thwaites)**,
* **Hasse's algorithm (after Helmut Hasse)**
* or the **Syracuse problem**.

## Let's dive deep into the problem

---

1. pick any positive(+ve).
2. If it's odd, we need to multiply it by 3 and 1 to it.
3. If the number is even, we need to divide it by 2.

For every +ve integer, we apply the rule and plot/track the number it will form a 4,2,1 loop. i.e- each number will end with 4,2,1 path.

**Note:-** The number we get after applying this conjecture, are called **<u>HailStone Number</u>**.

## Is the Collatz conjecture solvable ?

The Collatz conjecture states that the orbit of every number under f eventually reaches 1. And while no one has proved the conjecture, it has been verified for every number less than 268. So if you're looking for a counterexample, you can start around 300 quintillion.
